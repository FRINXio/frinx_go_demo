// Optional[ A Network Link connects a by Local (Source) node and a Remote (Destination) Network Nodes via a set of the nodes' termination points. As it is possible to have several links between the same source and destination nodes, and as a link could potentially be re-homed between termination points, to ensure that we would always know to distinguish between links, every link is identified by a dedicated link identifier. Note that a link models a point-to-point link, not a multipoint link. Layering dependencies on links in underlay topologies are not represented as the layering information of nodes and of termination points is sufficient. ] REF:Optional.empty
